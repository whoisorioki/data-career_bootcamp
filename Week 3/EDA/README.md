## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA is the process of exploring and analyzing data sets to understand their main characteristics, patterns, relationships, and anomalies. 
Here are the typical steps involved in EDA:

 1. Data collection: The first step is to gather data from various sources and store them in a structured format such as CSV, Excel, or a database.
 2. Data cleaning: The second step is to clean the data by removing irrelevant, incomplete, or inconsistent observations, correcting data errors and inconsistencies, and dealing with missing values and outliers.
 3. Data visualization: The third step is to create various charts, graphs, and other visualizations to understand the distribution, correlation, and relationship between different variables. This can include histograms, scatter plots, box plots, heatmaps, and others.
 4. Data analysis: The fourth step is to perform statistical analysis to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in the data, and to derive insights and conclusions. This may involve using statistical techniques such as regression analysis, correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, and clustering.
 5. Communication of insights: Finally, the results of the EDA should be communicated to stakeholders using clear and concise visualizations, charts, and reports. This helps to ensure that everyone understands the insights and implications of the data, and can make informed decisions based on them.
